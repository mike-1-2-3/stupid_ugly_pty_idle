This was my "seriously learn C++" project. As such, the code is hideous. Any employers or peers who find this are urged to NOT judge me.

It was shaping up to be a cool game, so I started re-writing the code from scratch. Predictably, I got bored of the rewrite and may never finish it. I'm going through my old laptop before putting it in storage, and thought I'd throw this up online since the concepts are kind of neat.

I think there used to be a lengthy introduction segment that's currently disabled, it provided some context. Basically, you've inherited a kingdom in a grand fantasy universe with planes of existence ranging from the mundane to pure energy, etc. As peasants come of age you can make them become farmers or soldiers, etc. I was hoping to add a Dwarf Fortress level of detail to the production chains, just at a much larger scale.

Here's the combat screen with some blood spatter:

If this seems like the best thing ever and you want to continue development, I urge you to make an issue, and I'll post the beginnings of the re-write and I might be interested in spending some time on it again.
